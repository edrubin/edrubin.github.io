### Natural gas elasticities and heterogeneity: Evidence from 300M+ bills

with [Maximilian Auffhammer](http://www.auffhammer.com)

In this paper, we estimate the elasticity of demand for residential natural gas using a two-fold empirical strategy that combines (1) a spatial discontinuity between two natural gas utilities and (2) an instrumental variables approach. We estimate significant seasonal and income-based heterogeneity in this elasticity and describe the importance of this heterogeneity for efficient and progressive policy.

## Presentations

Example

## R scripts

Example in R:

```{r, eval = F}
1 + 1
```

## LaTeX

My LaTeX (beamer) template: [.tex file](MiscFiles/beamerTemplate.tex) | [example PDF](MiscFiles/beamerTemplate.pdf)

## Bash

### Git

Remove a file (`your.file`) from Git's cache
```{bash, eval = F}
git rm --cached your.file
```

Begin tracking a file extension (`.eg`) with Git's [Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (LFS) and check the `.gitattributes` file for success.
```{bash, eval = F}
git lfs track "*.eg"
nano .gitattributes
```

Check which files LFS currently tracks.
```{bash, eval = F}
git lfs ls-files
```

### Pandoc

Convert a Markdown (`.txt`) file to Word (`.docx`).
```{bash, eval = F}
pandoc -Ss example.txt -o example.docx
```

Convert a Markdown (`.txt`) file to PDF (`.pdf`).
```{bash, eval = F}
pandoc -Ss example.txt -o example.pdf
```

### Renaming

Place a "1" between the first four characters and the subsequent characters in each filename in a folder.
```{bash, eval = F}
for i in *; do mv $i "${i:0:4}1${i:4}"; done
```
