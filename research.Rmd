#### __The economic impact of critical-habitat designation: Evidence from vacant-land transactions__

[Maximilian Auffhammer](https://auffhammer.com), [Maya Duru](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/duru), [Edward Rubin](https://edrub.in), and [David L. Sunding](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/david-l-sunding)

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires the federal government to designate critical habitat for species listed as threatened or endangered. This provision of the ESA has proven to be one of its most controversial, as critical-habitat land designation entails special management—and potentially greater regulation. In this paper we measure the economic impact of critical-habitat designation by estimating its effect on the market value of vacant land. Using data from over 13,000 vacant-land transactions that occurred within or near critical habitat for two important species in California (red-legged frog and Bay checkerspot butterfly), we show that critical-habitat designation resulted in a large and statistically significant decrease in land value. The estimated impact of critical-habitat designation is heterogeneous: the largest decreases occur within designated urban-growth boundaries.

#### __Bringing Satellite-Based Air-Quality Estimates Down to Earth__

[Meredith Fowlie](https://www.meredithfowlie.com), [Edward Rubin](https://edrub.in), and [Reed Walker](https://w-reed-walker.com)

We use state-of-the-art, satellite-based PM2.5 estimates to assess the extent to which the EPA's existing, monitor-based measurements over- or under-estimate true exposure to PM2.5 pollution. Treating satellite-based estimates as truth implies a substantial number of "policy errors"—over-regulating areas that comply with air quality standards and under-regulating other areas that appear to violate standards. We investigate the health implications of these apparent errors and highlight the importance of accounting for prediction error in satellite-based estimates. Uncertainty in "policy errors" increases substantially when we account for these underlying prediction errors.

#### __Decomposing "the" Elasticity of Demand: Empirical and Policy Insights from 300 Million Natural Gas Bills__

with [Maximilian Auffhammer](http://www.auffhammer.com)

Public policy typically employs time- and group-invariant policies—partially due to historical limits that prevented precise identification of the heterogeneity underlying key parameters. We consider an important market—natural gas—where these limits have been relaxed and harness 300 million residential bills to identify income- and season-specific own-price elasticities. Exploiting service-territory spatial discontinuities and household-specific exogenous time-series variation, we show this demand elasticity varies substantially across seasons, income groups, and their interaction—from 0.06 (summer) to –0.61 (winter). This heterogeneity suggests an unexplored, *implementable*, and generalizable policy avenue—shifting fixed costs of operation into summer months—that is potentially more efficient and progressive than prevailing practices.

#### __Do aerially applied pesticides affect local air quality? Empirical evidence from California's San Joaquin Valley__

Many policymakers, public-health advocates, and citizen groups question whether current pesticide regulations properly equate the marginal social costs of pesticide applications to their marginal social benefits—with particular concern for negative health effects stemming from pesticide exposure. Additionally, recent research and policies in public health, epidemiology, and economics emphasize how fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations harm humans through increased mortality, morbidity, mental health issues, and a host of socioeconomic outcomes. This paper presents the first empirical evidence that aerially applied pesticides increase local PM2.5 concentrations. To causally estimate this effect, I combine the universe of aerial pesticide applications in the five southern counties of California's San Joaquin Valley (1.8M reports) with the U.S. EPA's PM2.5 monitoring network—exploiting (__1__) spatiotemporal variation in aerial pesticide applications and (__2__) variation in local wind patterns. I find significant evidence that (upwind) aerial pesticide applications within 1.5km increase local PM2.5 concentrations. The magnitudes of the point estimates suggest that the top decile of aerial applications may sufficiently increase local PM2.5 to warrant concern for human health.
