I live in Eugene, Oregon (USA) with my amazing wife, [Shelley](http://yourwritinghelper.com), and awesome kids, Theo and Clara. I am currently an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oregon. I received my PhD from the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. Before studying at UC Berkley, I earned a B.S. in mathematics, an M.S. in statistics, and an M.S. in agricultural economics—all at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.

When not at school, I enjoy exploring both rural and urban places. He loves data, maps, Truth, Beauty, and good food. And bikes.
