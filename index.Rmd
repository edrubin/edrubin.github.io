Ed Rubin is an assistant professor in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.uoregon.edu) at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu). His main research interests include the economics of the environment, energy, and natural resources; inequality; health; and development. He is also interested in rural communities and agriculture, drug and criminal policies, and general empirical policy analysis/data science (econometrics, statistics, machine learning, spatial analysis, _etc._).

Ed is a lover of data, (beautiful) graphs, maps, Venn diagrams, and people. He is an avid consumer of pizza, phở, tacos, coffee, and computational power. He is also a bunch of other things.
