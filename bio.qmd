I live in Eugene, Oregon (USA) with my amazing wife, [Shelley](http://yourwritinghelper.com), and our awesome kids—Theo, Clara, and Wendell.

I am an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oregon. I received my PhD from the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. Before studying at UC Berkley, I earned a B.S. in mathematics, an M.S. in statistics, and an M.S. in agricultural economics—all at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.

If not at school, I'm hopefully outside and/or playing with my family. I love people, data, trees, maps, Truth, Beauty, and good food. And bikes.
